Presentation website is designed using HTML and CSS. I have used CSS variables, Keyframe animations, CSS transitions.CSS variables are awesome and it improves development experience a lot and helps you centralize certain aspects of the webpage. Keyframe animations and transitions let you animate things.Have a look at it [Zoo Zoo's presentation](https://zoozoo.netlify.app)
